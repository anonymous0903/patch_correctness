This directory stores resulting tables of ranking of correct for each bug.
1. {tool}-ASE-prapr-correct-rank denotes the ranking of 'correct' patch in the ASE patches or ASE patches + prapr patches, respectively.
(If there are multiple correct patches, we select the one with highest ranking)
This corresponds to the scenario where developers get a few candidate plausible patch and rank them according to the scores. Patches are checked one by one until the correc patch is identified.
We can observe the ranking on the right is overally lower(darker) than on the left.

(#Note that we only consider bugs that have at least one correct patch and one overfitting patch.)

2. {tool}-ASE-prapr-dev-rank denotes the ranking of 'developer' patch. 
Specifically, we count for each bug, how many overfitting patches (generated by tools) are ranked higher than developer patches.
This can prove the ineffectiveness of similarity-based technique when developer patches are considered.
We can also observe the ranking on the right is overally lower(darker) than on the left.

(#Note that we only consider bugs that have at least one overfitting patch.)
