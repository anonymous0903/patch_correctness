_DL4PatchCorrectness_ was linked to the original program of __Embedding__.

* __Dataset__
  * 1.2: Patches generated by PraPR, version 1.2.
  * 1.2_2.0: Patches generated by PraPR, version 2.0.
  * 2.2: Patches generated by PraPR which are in version 2.0 while not in version 1.2.
  * 870_data_filtered: Patches generated from Tian et.al. dataset for building the training model. Those patches which are overlapped with PraPR dataset were filtered.
  * prapr_src_patches
    Use the patches generated by PraPR(1.2 and 2.0) and its related files(the .java files) to get the code fragments for similarity evaluation.
  * test_cosine_sim: Fragments* are code fragments for each correct & incorrect source(patched) code; vec_sim* are consine similarity value for every code fragment.

* __evaluate_attetion.py__
    * Evaluate the performance of embedding based on the training model and test it on our PraPR dataset. You can put it under DL4PatchCorrectness/prediction and run it.

* __*.pickle__
    * .pickle files should be put DL4PatchCorrectness/data/experiment3/. You can use these files to reproduce the performance results.
